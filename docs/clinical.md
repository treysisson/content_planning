### Vitamin K2 (60mcg daily)

**Major Trial: NCT00150969 (ECKO Trial)**
- **Study Design**: 2-4 year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
- **Participants**: 440 postmenopausal women with osteopenia
- **Duration**: 2-4 years
- **Published**: PLoS Medicine 2008

**Key Findings:**
- âœ… **Fracture Reduction**: 55% fewer clinical fractures (9 vs 20, p=0.04)
- âœ… **Cancer Protection**: 75% fewer cancers (3 vs 12, p=0.02)
- âœ… **Safety**: Well-tolerated over 4-year period
- âœ… **Bone Quality**: Improved bone strength independent of density

**Clinical Significance**: While K2 didn't prevent bone loss, it showed significant protective effects against fractures in postmenopausal women with osteopenia.

### Magnesium Bisglycinate (79mg daily)

**Clinical Evidence Summary:**

**Superior Bioavailability:**
- **Absorption Rate**: 18.8% vs 4% for magnesium oxide
- **Digestive Tolerance**: Significantly less GI upset
- **Clinical Effectiveness**: Better at raising serum magnesium levels

**Women's Health Benefits:**
- âœ… **Muscle Function**: Reduces muscle cramps, spasms, and tension
- âœ… **Hormonal Support**: May help balance hormones during menopause transition
- âœ… **Bone Health**: Associated with lower osteoporosis risk in postmenopausal women
- âœ… **Sleep Quality**: Improved sleep in magnesium-deficient women

**Clinical Significance**: Superior bioavailability makes it the preferred form for addressing magnesium deficiency, which affects up to 50% of Americans, with women more susceptible than men.

---

### Zinc Bisglycinate (1.7mg daily)

**Clinical Context:**
While specific trials for zinc bisglycinate in women's muscle recovery are limited, zinc is well-established for:

- âœ… **Protein Synthesis**: Essential cofactor for muscle protein synthesis
- âœ… **Recovery**: Critical for tissue repair and immune function
- âœ… **Bioavailability**: Chelated forms show superior absorption vs inorganic forms
- âœ… **Hormonal Support**: Important for hormone production and regulation

**Clinical Significance**: The bisglycinate form ensures optimal absorption without the gastric irritation common with other zinc forms.

### Grass-Fed Beef Protein Isolate (26g daily)

**Clinical Context:**
While specific trials comparing beef protein to whey in women are limited, the evidence supports:

- âœ… **Complete Amino Profile**: Contains all essential amino acids for muscle protein synthesis
- âœ… **High Bioavailability**: Comparable protein quality to whey without dairy
- âœ… **Muscle Maintenance**: High-quality proteins support muscle maintenance in aging women
- âœ… **Allergen-Friendly**: Alternative for those with dairy sensitivities (60% of adults)

**Supporting Evidence**: Studies on protein intake in postmenopausal women consistently show benefits of 25-30g daily protein for muscle preservation.
