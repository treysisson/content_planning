### Because slowing down isn't an option

Women's bodies change in ways most supplements and protein powders don't fully address — muscle is harder to maintain, joints begin to ache, bone strength declines quietly, and recovery slows.

And yet, life only speeds up: leading teams, raising kids, caring for aging parents, managing a thousand invisible demands. There's no time to juggle five powders and pills.

That's why we spent six months working closely with clinicians, RDs, nutritionists, and PhDs in Food Science to develop one simple, science-backed formula — designed to support lean muscle, protect joints and cartilage, and strengthen bones in one daily step, so you stay strong, resilient and nimble.

10-15% muscle loss per decade after age 30, unless you actively intervene.
