## [INGREDIENT DEEP-DIVE SECTION]

**HEADLINE:** Formulated with Purpose. No Fillers. Ever.

**(This can be an accordion-style section where clicking an ingredient reveals its description.)**

**[Ingredient 1: Swedish Grass-Fed Beef Protein Isolate]**
**Why we chose it:** A gut-friendly, dairy-free, and complete protein source. It delivers the essential amino acids your muscles need to repair and strengthen, without the bloat associated with whey.

**[Ingredient 2: Creatine Monohydrate]**
**Why we chose it:** It's one of the most studied and effective supplements for women. Creatine is proven to enhance strength, improve power output, and support lean muscle mass—it's the key to fighting strength-loss.

**[Ingredient 3: Type I & III Collagen]**
**Why we chose it:** These are the specific types of collagen that make up your skin, tendons, and ligaments. Supplementing with them provides the building blocks to maintain joint health and tissue elasticity.

**[Ingredient 4: The Support Team (Vitamins & Minerals)]**
**Why we chose it:** We use the most bioavailable forms of key micronutrients—like Magnesium Bisglycinate and Zinc Bisglycinate—to ensure your body can actually absorb and use them to support everything from muscle function to energy metabolism.

## [FAQ SECTION]

**HEADLINE:** Your Questions, Answered Honestly.

**(Accordion style)**

**[Q1: Who is this for?]**
A: Nimble Daily is specifically designed for active women aged 35+ who are looking for a simple, effective way to support their long-term strength, joint health, and bone density.

**[Q2: How is this different from other protein powders?]**
A: It's a 4-in-1 functional formula, not just a protein supplement. We combine protein with creatine, collagen, and essential minerals at clinically-effective doses to provide comprehensive support you won't find in a standard protein or collagen powder.

**[Q3: Will creatine make me bulky?]**
A: No. This is a common myth. At the 3g dose we use, creatine will help improve your strength and power, but it will not cause bulky muscle growth. It helps you build stronger, leaner muscle.

**[Q4: What does it taste like?]**
A: We are transparent: it doesn't taste like a milkshake. It is unflavored and has a neutral, slightly savory taste from the beef protein. It's designed to be mixed with water or into a smoothie where it will be easily masked. We chose efficacy and cleanliness over artificial sweeteners and flavors.
