Made from grass-fed beef and bones for true nose-to-tail nutrition - but tastes like dessert with a rich, creamy texture.\n\n![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1134/7250/files/placeholder-1.jpg?v=1634935540)\n\n## Why use beef over other protein sources (like whey)?\n\nBeef protein is packed with the collagen, gelatin, and micro-nutrients your body needs. Unlike other protein powders, it’s not packed with possible allergens found in soy, dairy, egg, or whey. Studies have shown that beef protein provides additional benefits to strength, hypertrophy, and fat loss over whey.\n\n![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1134/7250/files/1.png?v=1655292464)\n\n## Super good for you, and still tastes like dessert\n\nPrime Protein tastes like dessert (vanilla, strawberry or chocolate - you pick!).

Keep going!\n\n- ### Why not just eat beef instead of taking a supplement?\n\n\nWe encourage our customers to maintain a well-balanced diet but it’s not always possible (or preferred) to eat a full steak meal. Prime Protein is the easiest way to get the benefits of 4 oz. of grass-fed beef, in a single scoop. Use Prime Protein for a meal supplement, or as a post-workout boost.\n\n- ### Why use beef over other protein sources (like whey)?\n\n\nBeef protein is packed with the collagen, gelatin, and micro-nutrients your body needs. Unlike other protein powders, it’s not packed with possible allergens found in soy, dairy, egg, or whey. Our careful dose of real-food ingredients gives you the nutrients you need to build muscle, and repair ligaments, tendons, joins, hair, and skin. Plus, Prime Protein is non-inflammatory. Most other animal-based protein powders can cause inflammation (such as powders made from egg protein), not beef protein. It’s just 21-grams of 100% grass-fed beef in every scoop. Lastly, studies have shown that beef protein provides additional benefits to strength, hypertrophy, and fat loss over whey.\n\n- ### Does Prime Protein taste like beef?\n\n\nNot at all. We’ve spent years creating the perfect blend of ingredients so you get the benefits of beef protein, in a delicious supplement. The all-natural cocoa powder and stevia we use make Prime Protein subtly sweet. Many customers say it tastes like chocolate brownies!\n\n- ### Why should I choose Prime Protein over other beef protein supplements?\n\n\nYour body wants to be fed real foods only, but most other supplements on the market are loaded with chemicals, fillers, and artificial flavors. Worse yet, they hide this from you, the consumer. Only Equip is 100% transparent about the ingredients inside our products. Prime Protein is made from just three ingredients: grass-fed beef, all natural cocoa powder, and stevia. Grass-fed beef gives you the nutrients you need to support your health goals, including staying lean, increasing strength, and boosting muscle recovery. Plus, we make Prime Protein the same way bone broth is made: Heated on low so that the protein dissolves into a broth. This preserves the nutrition of the beef. You get the full benefits of a 4 oz cut of beef, in a powder you can add to any meal or drink.\n\n- ### How much protein is in every serving?\n\n\nThere are 21 grams of protein for every serving. That’s 10% more than the industry average, meaning you get more grass-fed beef protein in every scoop.\n\n- ### How many servings per bag?\n\n\nPrime Protein contains 30 servings of muscle-building beef protein per bag. Most customers use Prime Protein daily, meaning each container offers a month’s supply. With our subscription delivery services, you can get your monthly supply delivered to you automatically—and save 15% off your order.\n\n- ### When should I take Prime Protein?\n\n\nPrime Protein is the perfect supplement to have whenever you want 21 grams of grass-fed beef protein, that’s because it has a full complement of amino acids (unlike plant-based proteins). It’s more than a supplement. It’s a natural source of the collagen, gelatin and micro-nutrients you’d find in a 4 oz. steak. Take Prime Protein after a workout to build muscle and repair ligaments and take it as a meal replacement. With Prime Protein, it’s never been easier to feed your body.\n\n- ### What is Prime Protein's amino acid profile?\n\n\nPrime Protein provides complete protein. Below is our amino acid profile. Typical values. Grams per 25g serving: Alanine: 2.2 Arginine: 1.89 Aspartic acid: 1.5 Cystine + cystein: 0.03 Glutamic acid: 2.75 Glycine: 5 Histidine: 0.28 Hydroxyproline: 2.55 Isoleucine: 0.43 Leucine: 0.93 Lysine: 0.95 Methionine: 0.23 Phenylalanine: 0.58 Proline: 3 Serine: 0.85 Threonine: 0.53 Tryptophane: 0.09 Tyrosine: 0.33 Valine: 0.75\n\n- ### Do you use chemicals to process the grass-fed beef?\n\n\nNo! We strictly use thermal and mechanical processing to keep our grass-fed beef clean.\n\n- ### What are your natural flavors?\n\n\nOur natural flavors are distilled vapors from natural and organic compounds/fruits like vanilla, coconut, and strawberry processed without any chemicals, fillers, binders, or artificial ingredients. We know most natural flavors are garbage - we are very careful with our sourcing and vetting as a result.

Unlike other protein powders, it’s not packed with possible allergens found in soy, dairy, egg, or whey. Studies have shown that beef protein provides additional benefits to strength, hypertrophy, and fat loss over whey.\n\n![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1134/7250/files/1.png?v=1655292464)\n\n## Super good for you, and still tastes like dessert\n\nPrime Protein tastes like dessert (vanilla, strawberry or chocolate - you pick!).

Keep going!\n\n- ### Why not just eat beef instead of taking a supplement?\n\n\nWe encourage our customers to maintain a well-balanced diet but it’s not always possible (or preferred) to eat a full steak meal. Prime Protein is the easiest way to get the benefits of 4 oz. of grass-fed beef, in a single scoop. Use Prime Protein for a meal supplement, or as a post-workout boost.\n\n- ### Why use beef over other protein sources (like whey)?\n\n\nBeef protein is packed with the collagen, gelatin, and micro-nutrients your body needs. Unlike other protein powders, it’s not packed with possible allergens found in soy, dairy, egg, or whey. Our careful dose of real-food ingredients gives you the nutrients you need to build muscle, and repair ligaments, tendons, joins, hair, and skin. Plus, Prime Protein is non-inflammatory. Most other animal-based protein powders can cause inflammation (such as powders made from egg protein), not beef protein. It’s just 21-grams of 100% grass-fed beef in every scoop. Lastly, studies have shown that beef protein provides additional benefits to strength, hypertrophy, and fat loss over whey.\n\n- ### Does Prime Protein taste like beef?\n\n\nNot at all. We’ve spent years creating the perfect blend of ingredients so you get the benefits of beef protein, in a delicious supplement. The all-natural cocoa powder and stevia we use make Prime Protein subtly sweet. Many customers say it tastes like chocolate brownies!\n\n- ### Why should I choose Prime Protein over other beef protein supplements?\n\n\nYour body wants to be fed real foods only, but most other supplements on the market are loaded with chemicals, fillers, and artificial flavors. Worse yet, they hide this from you, the consumer. Only Equip is 100% transparent about the ingredients inside our products. Prime Protein is made from just three ingredients: grass-fed beef, all natural cocoa powder, and stevia. Grass-fed beef gives you the nutrients you need to support your health goals, including staying lean, increasing strength, and boosting muscle recovery. Plus, we make Prime Protein the same way bone broth is made: Heated on low so that the protein dissolves into a broth. This preserves the nutrition of the beef. You get the full benefits of a 4 oz cut of beef, in a powder you can add to any meal or drink.\n\n- ### How much protein is in every serving?\n\n\nThere are 21 grams of protein for every serving. That’s 10% more than the industry average, meaning you get more grass-fed beef protein in every scoop.\n\n- ### How many servings per bag?\n\n\nPrime Protein contains 30 servings of muscle-building beef protein per bag. Most customers use Prime Protein daily, meaning each container offers a month’s supply. With our subscription delivery services, you can get your monthly supply delivered to you automatically—and save 15% off your order.\n\n- ### When should I take Prime Protein?\n\n\nPrime Protein is the perfect supplement to have whenever you want 21 grams of grass-fed beef protein, that’s because it has a full complement of amino acids (unlike plant-based proteins). It’s more than a supplement. It’s a natural source of the collagen, gelatin and micro-nutrients you’d find in a 4 oz. steak. Take Prime Protein after a workout to build muscle and repair ligaments and take it as a meal replacement. With Prime Protein, it’s never been easier to feed your body.\n\n- ### What is Prime Protein's amino acid profile?\n\n\nPrime Protein provides complete protein. Below is our amino acid profile. Typical values. Grams per 25g serving: Alanine: 2.2 Arginine: 1.89 Aspartic acid: 1.5 Cystine + cystein: 0.03 Glutamic acid: 2.75 Glycine: 5 Histidine: 0.28 Hydroxyproline: 2.55 Isoleucine: 0.43 Leucine: 0.93 Lysine: 0.95 Methionine: 0.23 Phenylalanine: 0.58 Proline: 3 Serine: 0.85 Threonine: 0.53 Tryptophane: 0.09 Tyrosine: 0.33 Valine: 0.75\n\n- ### Do you use chemicals to process the grass-fed beef?\n\n\nNo! We strictly use thermal and mechanical processing to keep our grass-fed beef clean.\n\n- ### What are your natural flavors?\n\n\nOur natural flavors are distilled vapors from natural and organic compounds/fruits like vanilla, coconut, and strawberry processed without any chemicals, fillers, binders, or artificial ingredients. We know most natural flavors are garbage - we are very careful with our sourcing and vetting as a result.

Of course we had to try it for ourselves! Until further notice, this shake IS THE SHAKE! We feel great and we are spreading the word! Thanks for all of your hard work to bring us the holy Grail of nutrition shakes!\n\nM.R.\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n10/02/2023\n\nThe only supplement I take now.\n\nLet me start by saying that Momentum has completely revolutionized my health and well-being. I can't help but be amazed at the results I've achieved since incorporating this shake into my daily routine. It has become an absolute game-changer.\n\nFirst things first, the taste of Momentum is unparalleled. It's not just good; it's the epitome of deliciousness in a health shake. But what truly matters is the impact it has had on my energy levels, focus, and overall performance. The results have far exceeded my expectations.\n\nI now experience a sustained level of energy that keeps me going strong throughout the day. This newfound vitality has made a remarkable difference in my productivity and overall quality of life.\n\nThe boost in focus and mental clarity I've experienced has been great. I no longer find myself struggling to concentrate or battling brain fog when I have particularly heavy workload. I ditched all my other supplements and will be sticking to this one, as it’s had the greatest impact for me.\n\nThanks for making such a great product. Look forward to continued results!\n\nMike Simpson\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n07/06/2023\n\nThe ingredients are far more robust and diverse than any other similar product out there.\n\nThe taste mirrors that of a not so healthy alternative, in other words it's delicious. Without having a predetermined expectation, I legitimately felt an increase in cognitive functions and an overall sense of this product is good for me. I'm a lifetime fan now.\n\nM.D.\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n07/03/2023\n\n51 6’2” 207\n\nMomentum is my go to every day every morning of every day. It is everything that I’ve been looking for in a supplement for over a decade. It works my body feels like it did when I was 35 it took probably about 45 days of consumption to get to this point, it is a noticeable point of recovery that I feel every day, best supplement I’ve ever bought ….\n\nROBERT BAUMAN\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/29/2023\n\nEverything you need in one shake!\n\nI have tried quite a few different shakes and I really really like this one. Other shakes do have some fun flavors but this one is wayyy better for you. It literal has everything you need for optimal health. I don’t need to take a bunch of other pills or supplements along with this. The chocolate is great and it is so smooth, literally no clumping at all! So excited I found this!!!\n\nJessica Cullum\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/27/2023\n\nflavor, amount of protein and it is creamy\n\nLove love love this protein collagen powder.

The taste is great! (Chocolate!) I also love that it shakes up tea well and there aren’t any chunks of protein. I also love that there is more than just protein. I feel great after drinking this!!!\n\nJessica Cullum\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/22/2023\n\nThe noticeable improvements it makes on my mind and body!\n\nAfter taking Momentum every day for nearly 3 months, I can safely say that I recommend it to anyone that is serious about their health.\n\nOne month into daily use, I noticed that my sleep quantity and quality started to improve, as well as my mental clarity and recovery from performance. I would be shocked if I didn't notice such benefits -- the ingredients in here are top notch and would cost a fortune to buy individually. I am grateful that they have created an all-in-one protein shake/multivitamin to save time an energy for all of us (not to mention how transparent they are with the amount of each ingredient in each serving :)).\n\nIf I had only one thing I would change about it, it's the flavor. I find it to be quite bitter (not the \"ice cream\" that Ben Greenfield described it as in his video advertisement). Obviously, we can't always get the best of both worlds, but I would be excited to try different flavors and with slightly sweeter tastes.\n\nThank you, Momentum!\n\nRichard Wallsten\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/20/2023\n\nMomentum is full of high quality ingredients with a longevity focus, all in one daily shake.\n\nMomentum is now my simple and single start to each day. It has everything you need for longevity and nothing you don't. Rather than pack it full of ingredients your body will throw out anyway (or that you aren't even deficient on), Momentum gives you what you really need in a simple morning shake. I now have more energy, quicker recovery, better blood markers, and a simplified morning routine.\n\nJoshua Schultz\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/19/2023\n\nThis stuff is changing my life\n\nCan’t say enough good things about this shake. It tastes absolutely amazing while providing substantial and sustainable energy throughout the day. I feel great and my skin even looks better after just two weeks of taking momentum.\n\nThank you to the team putting this together! It’s much appreciated!\n\nLogan Lester\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/16/2023\n\nThe best shake I've had\n\nI started drinking momentum several months ago and I've been able to build muscle better than when I was 10 years younger. I'm stronger and feeling better than I have in a long time.\n\nI was paying $150 per month for a combination of supplements (Protein powder, vitamin D, mushroom blend, b complex, collagen) that were 25% of what is offered in this one shake. It was a no brainer to switch and get the added benefits of NAD+ !\n\nThe added fiber has also made a noticeable difference in making me feel better.\n\nAND... it's delicious so I look forward to it daily.\n\nDavid Shapiro\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/12/2023\n\nACTUALLY Delicious!\n\nIt's rare for a product to nail the trifecta: Momentum tastes great, includes the highest qualities ingredients, AND follows the latest science about longevity and optimal living. Highly recommend!\n\nTheodore Gurman\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n05/09/2023\n\nI showed Momentum to my Doctor and now he's taking it!\n\nI feel better every day and this tastes incredible!! Best shake I've ever had, but you really can't compare it to anything else because it has so many more things. It replaced at least 10 expensive supplements I was taking and made it cheaper and way easier. I've had Athletic greens, eww, and Kachava, fine but mostly \"super food\" bs. It's not close! My skin is better, my tummy is better, I feel better. Go get it!\n\nStephanie Sutton\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n05/08/2023\n\n- [Contact Us](https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/contact)\n- [Shipping &

Momentum is a huge hit in our home. My wife Carly wants that for meals instead of the food I cook, and I'm a good cook! THAT is how delicious it is.

Of course we had to try it for ourselves! Until further notice, this shake IS THE SHAKE! We feel great and we are spreading the word! Thanks for all of your hard work to bring us the holy Grail of nutrition shakes!\n\nM.R.\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n10/02/2023\n\nThe only supplement I take now.\n\nLet me start by saying that Momentum has completely revolutionized my health and well-being. I can't help but be amazed at the results I've achieved since incorporating this shake into my daily routine. It has become an absolute game-changer.\n\nFirst things first, the taste of Momentum is unparalleled. It's not just good; it's the epitome of deliciousness in a health shake. But what truly matters is the impact it has had on my energy levels, focus, and overall performance. The results have far exceeded my expectations.\n\nI now experience a sustained level of energy that keeps me going strong throughout the day. This newfound vitality has made a remarkable difference in my productivity and overall quality of life.\n\nThe boost in focus and mental clarity I've experienced has been great. I no longer find myself struggling to concentrate or battling brain fog when I have particularly heavy workload. I ditched all my other supplements and will be sticking to this one, as it’s had the greatest impact for me.\n\nThanks for making such a great product. Look forward to continued results!\n\nMike Simpson\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n07/06/2023\n\nThe ingredients are far more robust and diverse than any other similar product out there.\n\nThe taste mirrors that of a not so healthy alternative, in other words it's delicious. Without having a predetermined expectation, I legitimately felt an increase in cognitive functions and an overall sense of this product is good for me. I'm a lifetime fan now.\n\nM.D.\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n07/03/2023\n\n51 6’2” 207\n\nMomentum is my go to every day every morning of every day. It is everything that I’ve been looking for in a supplement for over a decade. It works my body feels like it did when I was 35 it took probably about 45 days of consumption to get to this point, it is a noticeable point of recovery that I feel every day, best supplement I’ve ever bought ….\n\nROBERT BAUMAN\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/29/2023\n\nEverything you need in one shake!\n\nI have tried quite a few different shakes and I really really like this one. Other shakes do have some fun flavors but this one is wayyy better for you. It literal has everything you need for optimal health. I don’t need to take a bunch of other pills or supplements along with this. The chocolate is great and it is so smooth, literally no clumping at all! So excited I found this!!!\n\nJessica Cullum\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/27/2023\n\nflavor, amount of protein and it is creamy\n\nLove love love this protein collagen powder. I have tried so many over the years, and this is the winner. Plus it is packed with all sorts of healthy extras,\n\nMimi Clark\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/26/2023\n\nHow delicious is it is.\n\nMomentum is the tastiest shake I've had. But the real reason I tried it out were fine ingredients. The doses are more appropriate compared to other products and I feel great after taking it.\n\nCaleb Fiedor\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/26/2023\n\nTop tier supplement\n\nBest all-in-one supplement on the market right now. Tastes great as well! 💯💯\n\nJonathan Kroll\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/23/2023\n\nDoesn’t hurt my stomach!\n\nThis is my absolute favorite protein shake! The taste is great! (Chocolate!) I also love that it shakes up tea well and there aren’t any chunks of protein. I also love that there is more than just protein. I feel great after drinking this!!!\n\nJessica Cullum\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/22/2023\n\nThe noticeable improvements it makes on my mind and body!\n\nAfter taking Momentum every day for nearly 3 months, I can safely say that I recommend it to anyone that is serious about their health.\n\nOne month into daily use, I noticed that my sleep quantity and quality started to improve, as well as my mental clarity and recovery from performance. I would be shocked if I didn't notice such benefits -- the ingredients in here are top notch and would cost a fortune to buy individually. I am grateful that they have created an all-in-one protein shake/multivitamin to save time an energy for all of us (not to mention how transparent they are with the amount of each ingredient in each serving :)).\n\nIf I had only one thing I would change about it, it's the flavor. I find it to be quite bitter (not the \"ice cream\" that Ben Greenfield described it as in his video advertisement). Obviously, we can't always get the best of both worlds, but I would be excited to try different flavors and with slightly sweeter tastes.\n\nThank you, Momentum!\n\nRichard Wallsten\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/20/2023\n\nMomentum is full of high quality ingredients with a longevity focus, all in one daily shake.\n\nMomentum is now my simple and single start to each day. It has everything you need for longevity and nothing you don't. Rather than pack it full of ingredients your body will throw out anyway (or that you aren't even deficient on), Momentum gives you what you really need in a simple morning shake. I now have more energy, quicker recovery, better blood markers, and a simplified morning routine.\n\nJoshua Schultz\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/19/2023\n\nThis stuff is changing my life\n\nCan’t say enough good things about this shake. It tastes absolutely amazing while providing substantial and sustainable energy throughout the day. I feel great and my skin even looks better after just two weeks of taking momentum.\n\nThank you to the team putting this together! It’s much appreciated!\n\nLogan Lester\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/16/2023\n\nThe best shake I've had\n\nI started drinking momentum several months ago and I've been able to build muscle better than when I was 10 years younger. I'm stronger and feeling better than I have in a long time.\n\nI was paying $150 per month for a combination of supplements (Protein powder, vitamin D, mushroom blend, b complex, collagen) that were 25% of what is offered in this one shake. It was a no brainer to switch and get the added benefits of NAD+ !\n\nThe added fiber has also made a noticeable difference in making me feel better.\n\nAND... it's delicious so I look forward to it daily.\n\nDavid Shapiro\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n06/12/2023\n\nACTUALLY Delicious!\n\nIt's rare for a product to nail the trifecta: Momentum tastes great, includes the highest qualities ingredients, AND follows the latest science about longevity and optimal living. Highly recommend!\n\nTheodore Gurman\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n05/09/2023\n\nI showed Momentum to my Doctor and now he's taking it!\n\nI feel better every day and this tastes incredible!! Best shake I've ever had, but you really can't compare it to anything else because it has so many more things. It replaced at least 10 expensive supplements I was taking and made it cheaper and way easier. I've had Athletic greens, eww, and Kachava, fine but mostly \"super food\" bs. It's not close! My skin is better, my tummy is better, I feel better. Go get it!\n\nStephanie Sutton\n\n[Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews)\n\n05/08/2023\n\n- [Contact Us](https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/contact)\n- [Shipping & Returns](https://www.momentumshake.com/policies/refund-policy)\n- [Privacy](https://www.momentumshake.com/policies/privacy-policy)\n- [Terms of Service](https://www.momentumshake.com/policies/terms-of-service)\n- [FAQs](https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/faqs)\n- [Refer a Friend](https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/refer-a-friend)\n- [Affiliate program](https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/affiliate-program)\n- [Manage Your Subscription](https://shopify.com/66645262554/account/profile?locale=en&region_country=US)\n\nCopyright © 2025, [Momentum Shake](https://www.momentumshake.com/ \"\")\n\n- Choosing a selection results in a full page refresh.\n- Opens in a new window.\n\n[iframe](https://www.momentumshake.com/wpm@34ff2d10wc059d4efp7924d635m7b7b0f0e/custom/web-pixel-shopify-custom-pixel@0420/sandbox/modern/)\n\n![Momentum](https://www.momentumshake.com/cdn/shop/files/MomentumEssentials.jpg?v=1685752471)\n\n![Down icon](https://cdn-app.sealsubscriptions.com/shopify/public/img/app/dwn.svg?v2)\n\n[Judge.me](https://www.momentumshake.com/#)","linksOnPage":["https://www.momentumshake.com/#MainContent","https://www.momentumshake.com/#shopify-section-template--16707866788058__e27c9146-4c72-4a1d-ab5e-849c9c2d4771","https://www.momentumshake.com/customer_authentication/redirect?locale=en&region_country=US","https://www.momentumshake.com/policies/shipping-policy","https://www.momentumshake.com/#shopify-section-template--16769409319130__6a8abe7c-c196-4b00-8610-d8d710413bef","https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/faqs","https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/reviews","https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/contact","https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/test-results","https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/refer-a-friend","https://www.momentumshake.com/pages/affiliate-program","https://shopify.com/66645262554/account/profile?locale=en&region_country=US","https://www.momentumshake.com/","https://www.momentumshake.com/#shopify-section-template--16769409319130__e27c9146-4c72-4a1d-ab5e-849c9c2d4771","https://www.momentumshake.com/cart","https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/260aaf4074ce4a7a8b438854a8cd2d66.mp4","https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/5009a72b1b0643baa4d156b9ee2f4766.mp4","https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/37cf5b5f68594765979f68ec2ffe9b4f.mp4","https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/461f914cfb8c4c46a5eab2a30bd3a320.mp4","https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/571cf295fbbf47e39ac310e2e84fe064.mp4","https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/ddf6a61e87c742c38c93ddc865948aa9.mp4","https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/ab7c11a6723e454c8efbdb2217254c32.mp4","https://www.momentumshake.com/#judgeme_product_reviews","https://www.momentumshake.com/policies/refund-policy","https://www.momentumshake.com/policies/privacy-policy","https://www.momentumshake.com/policies/terms-of-service","https://www.momentumshake.com/#"],"metadata":{"title":"\n      Momentum Longevity Shake\n – Momentum Shake","ogTitle":"Momentum Longevity Shake","twitter:title":"Momentum Longevity Shake","og:url":"https://www.momentumshake.com/","favicon":"https://www.momentumshake.com/cdn/shop/files/favicon.webp?crop=center&height=32&v=1671021340&width=32","ogDescription":"Momentum Longevity Shake.

We Have Answers!\n\nAre Kate Farms products certified organic?\n\nYes, all Kate Farms formulas are USDA certified organic.\n\nCan Kate Farms products be used for drinking and tube feeding?\n\nYes! All Kate Farms products, with the exception of Nutrition Shake, can be used for drinking or tube feeding. For tube feeding, our products flow smoothly in tubes down to a 6.5 French size. For tube feeding, our products (again, with the exception of Nutrition Shake) flow smoothly and without mechanical issues in the following enteral delivery systems: Infinity (by Moog), ePump, Joey (by Covidien), and Connect.\n\nWhat is the source of protein in your products?\n\nKate Farms shakes and formulas contain plant-based protein from organic yellow pea. Our standard formulas and Nutrition Shake contain intact pea protein (isolates), and our peptide formulas contain hydrolyzed pea protein (hydrolysates).\n\nKate Farms Pediatric Blended Meals contains a unique blend of organic whole foods, pea protein, and vitamins and minerals, to provide high-quality, complete nutrition that supports healthy growth and development.\n\nWhat is the difference between the pediatric products and the adult products?\n\nKate Farms pediatric products provide both micronutrients and macronutrients in amounts which support kiddos ages 1-13, while our adult products provide both micronutrients and macronutrients in amounts which supports age 14+. Additionally, our pediatric products are packaged in 8.45 oz cartons, while our adult products are packaged in 11oz cartons.

It helps maintain lean muscle mass and support muscle recovery after exercise. With 20 grams of protein, Essential Protein also provides a complete amino acid profile.\\*\n\n### What’s the source of your plant-based protein?\n\n![Plus](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nOur protein is sourced from regenerative-farmed peas grown exclusively in North America to lower the risk of high levels of heavy metal contamination and reduce our products' carbon footprint. We partner with our Supplier PURIS, who works with their network of hundreds of farmers on hundreds of thousands of acres to ensure a system of farming principles and practices that can increase soil biodiversity, enrich soil, improve water-sheds, and enhance ecosystem services through the capture of carbon and nitrogen in the soil.\n\n### What purchase and delivery options does Ritual offer?\n\n![Plus](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nRitual offers flexible options to fit your needs:\n\n1-Month Subscription: Enjoy automatic delivery of a 15 day supply every 30 days for consistent replenishment and convenience.\n\n3-Month Subscription: Receive a 45 day supply in one shipment, delivered every 90 days for added ease and efficiency.\n\nOne-Time Purchase: Buy a single 15 day supply without ongoing commitment.\n\n### What testing do you complete for Essential Protein?\n\n![Plus](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nWe go above and beyond when it comes to testing because we believe you deserve to know what you’re putting in your body and why. That’s why we not only do our own testing, but we also achieved Clean Label Project certification.\n\nThe Clean Label Project certification is considered one of the strictest for protecting consumers from harmful contaminants. CLP independently tests for hundreds of environmental contaminants and harmful chemicals like heavy metals (including lead, mercury, and glyphosate), pesticide residues, plasticizers, and antibiotic residues.\n\nAdditionally, our protein is tested for identity, purity, and composition so we can be sure that what’s on the label is what’s in the product. We also complete third-party testing to help ensure our products are compliant with regulations and guidelines for heavy metals, microbes, and major allergens and to help assure the quality and safety of our products.\n\n### Why don’t you include a scoop?\n\n![Plus](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nWe're always looking for ways to be more sustainable, and we found that by removing the scoop from our packaging we could reduce Essential Protein's carbon footprint by 22% while also eliminating plastic.† Instead of the scoop, you can use 5 tablespoons or ⅓ cup per serving. This is just one of the ways we are working towards our goal of 100% sustainable packaging by 2025.\n\n†Based on Ritual internal 2024 LCA\n\n### What is the packaging made from?\n\n![Plus](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nOur bag is made with 45% PCR (Post Consumer Recycled Material) and produces 84% fewer carbon emissions than plastic tubs.†\n\n†Based on Ritual internal 2024 LCA\n\n[See All FAQS \\\\\n![Arrow Right](<Base64-Image-Removed>)](https://help.ritual.com/)\n\n## Articles from the Journal\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height='400' width='600' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' version='1.1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\n![Meet Our Blueprint for a Nutritionally Balanced Smoothie](https://images.ctfassets.net/uuc5ok478nyh/3SPAFixVZYRxybIUo4sQ2/4ee4dfe949609e915ebccf58546ba39c/shake-hero.jpg?w=600&h=400&fl=progressive&q=90&fm=jpg&fit=fill&f=left)\\\\\n\\\\\nNutrition\\\\\n\\\\\nMeet Our Blueprint for a Nutritionally Balanced Smoothie\\\\\n\\\\\nPlus 3 RD-recommended recipes.](https://ritual.com/articles/healthy-smoothies)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height='400' width='600' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' version='1.1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\n![Pea Protein vs. Whey Protein: How Do They Stack Up?](https://images.ctfassets.net/uuc5ok478nyh/552MRtV5JEaZjNTnJl5WX5/21da01c70c37474f768fe7752e689803/Pea_vs_Whey_Protein.jpeg?w=600&h=400&fl=progressive&q=90&fm=jpg&fit=fill&f=left)\\\\\n\\\\\nNutrition\\\\\n\\\\\nPea Protein vs. Whey Protein: How Do They Stack Up?\\\\\n\\\\\nThe pros, the cons, and everything in between.](https://ritual.com/articles/pea-protein-vs-whey-protein)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height='400' width='600' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' version='1.1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\n![Meet Our Blueprint for a Nutritionally Balanced Smoothie](https://images.ctfassets.net/uuc5ok478nyh/3SPAFixVZYRxybIUo4sQ2/4ee4dfe949609e915ebccf58546ba39c/shake-hero.jpg?w=600&h=400&fl=progressive&q=90&fm=jpg&fit=fill&f=left)\\\\\n\\\\\nNutrition\\\\\n\\\\\nMeet Our Blueprint for a Nutritionally Balanced Smoothie\\\\\n\\\\\nPlus 3 RD-recommended recipes.](https://ritual.com/articles/healthy-smoothies)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height='400' width='600' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' version='1.1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\n![Pea Protein vs. Whey Protein: How Do They Stack Up?](https://images.ctfassets.net/uuc5ok478nyh/552MRtV5JEaZjNTnJl5WX5/21da01c70c37474f768fe7752e689803/Pea_vs_Whey_Protein.jpeg?w=600&h=400&fl=progressive&q=90&fm=jpg&fit=fill&f=left)\\\\\n\\\\\nNutrition\\\\\n\\\\\nPea Protein vs. Whey Protein: How Do They Stack Up?\\\\\n\\\\\nThe pros, the cons, and everything in between.](https://ritual.com/articles/pea-protein-vs-whey-protein)\n\n### Our Scientific Advisory Board\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height='300' width='300' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' version='1.1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![Science Team member Nima Alamdari](https://images.ctfassets.net/uuc5ok478nyh/5MXiWL3IeYoyz6PAJdhhDg/36ad5cf16b344c77224ec0d2e1e72fab/Nima-updated.jpg?w=300&h=300&fl=progressive&q=90&fm=jpg)\n\nDr. Nima Alamdari\n\nPhD\n\nChief Scientific Officer Prev.

Our protein is third-party certified with the Clean Label Project and won their Purity Award.\n\n2\n\n### Powered by Sustainably Sourced Regenerative Organic Peas\n\nWe source our regenerative organic peas exclusively from North America to lower the risk of high levels of heavy metal contamination and to reduce the carbon footprint of our products.††\n\n††Essential Protein is not organic and includes a combination of organic & non-organic ingredients\n\n3\n\n### Clean Formula, Sugar Free†\n\nEssential Protein is soy-free, gluten-free, vegan-friendly, and it’s formulated without GMOs, stevia, sugar or sugar alcohols, and artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.\n\n†Not a reduced calorie food\n\n4\n\n### Smooth, Creamy Taste\n\nLayers of sweet vanilla, nuances of caramel and hints of spice make Essential Protein fit to shake up your every day.

It helps maintain lean muscle mass and support muscle recovery after exercise. With 20 grams of protein, Essential Protein also provides a complete amino acid profile.\\*\n\n### What’s the source of your plant-based protein?\n\n![Plus](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nOur protein is sourced from regenerative-farmed peas grown exclusively in North America to lower the risk of high levels of heavy metal contamination and reduce our products' carbon footprint. We partner with our Supplier PURIS, who works with their network of hundreds of farmers on hundreds of thousands of acres to ensure a system of farming principles and practices that can increase soil biodiversity, enrich soil, improve water-sheds, and enhance ecosystem services through the capture of carbon and nitrogen in the soil.\n\n### What purchase and delivery options does Ritual offer?\n\n![Plus](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nRitual offers flexible options to fit your needs:\n\n1-Month Subscription: Enjoy automatic delivery of a 15 day supply every 30 days for consistent replenishment and convenience.\n\n3-Month Subscription: Receive a 45 day supply in one shipment, delivered every 90 days for added ease and efficiency.\n\nOne-Time Purchase: Buy a single 15 day supply without ongoing commitment.\n\n### What testing do you complete for Essential Protein?\n\n![Plus](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nWe go above and beyond when it comes to testing because we believe you deserve to know what you’re putting in your body and why. That’s why we not only do our own testing, but we also achieved Clean Label Project certification.\n\nThe Clean Label Project certification is considered one of the strictest for protecting consumers from harmful contaminants. CLP independently tests for hundreds of environmental contaminants and harmful chemicals like heavy metals (including lead, mercury, and glyphosate), pesticide residues, plasticizers, and antibiotic residues.\n\nAdditionally, our protein is tested for identity, purity, and composition so we can be sure that what’s on the label is what’s in the product. We also complete third-party testing to help ensure our products are compliant with regulations and guidelines for heavy metals, microbes, and major allergens and to help assure the quality and safety of our products.\n\n### Why don’t you include a scoop?\n\n![Plus](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nWe're always looking for ways to be more sustainable, and we found that by removing the scoop from our packaging we could reduce Essential Protein's carbon footprint by 22% while also eliminating plastic.† Instead of the scoop, you can use 5 tablespoons or ⅓ cup per serving.

ADM’s unique approach cuts out the middle-men from the traditional vanilla supply chain and gives more ownership directly back to farmers in Madagascar.\n\n3 / 3\n\n## More About Our Reviews\n\nWe only publish real reviews by real customers.

All of OWYN’s products require a strict gluten-free standard of <10 ppm (vs the FDA’s gluten-free standard of <20 ppm).\n\n09. #### What do BCAAs and essential amino acids do?\n\n\n    Proteins are made up of amino acids, which are the main building blocks of life. Essential amino acids can’t be made by the body and must be consumed through diet. BCAAs are three essential amino acids – leucine, isoleucine, and valine – that help build muscle and repair tissues. OWYN protein shakes provide all essential amino acids.\n\n10. #### Is sunflower oil bad for you?\n\n\n\n\n    Sunflower oil contains omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential fats. These essential fatty acids play an important role in overall health, including a reduction in heart disease risk.\n\n\n\n    OWYN Shakes also contain omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed oil. Omega-3s also play a role in overall health and disease prevention.\n\n11. #### I’m pregnant, can I drink OWYN?\n\n\n\n\n    We are proud to say that many pregnant moms-to-be drink OWYN! OWYN is recommended by OBGYNs nationwide. However, we always recommend speaking with a health care professional prior to making changes to your diet.\n\n\n- Get email updates.\nSign up for OWYN exclusive offers & updates!\n\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe →\n- Let's be friends\n  - [@onlywhatyouneed](https://www.facebook.com/onlywhatyouneed)\n  - [@liveowyn](https://www.instagram.com/liveowyn/)\n- Support\n  - [Contact](https://liveowyn.com/contact/)\n  - [Store Locator](https://destinilocators.com/owyn/site/locator.php?MM=panel2)\n  - [FAQ](https://liveowyn.com/faq/)\n  - [Subscription FAQ](https://liveowyn.com/subscription-faq/)\n  - [Loyalty and Referral FAQ](https://liveowyn.com/loyalty-and-referrals-faq/)\n  - [Refund Policy](https://liveowyn.com/refund-policy/)\n  - Accessibility\n- Info\n  - [OWYN Honors](https://account.liveowyn.com/pages/rewards)\n  - [Privacy Statement](https://liveowyn.com/privacy-policy/)\n  - [Terms of Service](https://liveowyn.com/terms-of-service/)\n  - [Resale Policy](https://liveowyn.com/authorized-resale-policy/)\n\n[OWYN \\| Only What You Need](https://liveowyn.com/) © OWYN 2025.

It provides you with all the carbohydrates, protein, fats, fiber, and all 27 essential micronutrients your body needs to thrive.\n\n## Is Black Edition a meal replacement?\n\nWhile meal replacements may seem similar to Huel Products, they are far from it. They are generally marketed and designed to support either weight loss or a fitness programme, and they're often low in calories. A two-scoop serving of Huel Black Edition is a nutritionally complete meal, containing 400 calories, a good amount of fibre and fats, and a low GI.\n\n## What is in the Black Edition Variety Box?\n\nThe Black Edition Variety Box contains three of our best-selling flavors, in one box! The perfect way to try multiple flavors and find your new favorite!\n\nThe only difference between these pouches and the rest of the Black Edition range is they are slightly smaller – they weight 31.75oz (900g) and contain 10 servings per bag. Standard Black Edition pouches weigh 54oz (1.53kg) and contain 17 servings per bag.\n\nEach pouch contains exactly the same ingredients and nutritional values as standard 17-serving Black Edition pouches.\n\n## How do I use Huel Black Edition?\n\nHuel Black Edition is quick and easy to prepare. Add **two level scoops (3 heaping tablespoons /90g)** to 1 **7 fl oz cold water with ice**, then **shake for 20 seconds**. For an extra smooth texture, you can also blend.\n\n## Is it a weight loss product?\n\nSimply, no. It’s a common misconception that carbohydrates make you gain weight. Huel Black Edition is food and weight loss is mainly about eating fewer calories than your body needs. Much like our Huel Powder and Ready-to-drink, it can help with making you feel full as it’s high in protein and fiber.\n\n## Is it suitable for a keto diet?\n\nIt could form part of a keto diet. However, a typical keto diet is typically higher in fat and lower in protein than Huel Black Edition.\n\n## Do I get free Huel stuff with my order?\n\nLike all first purchases at Huel, your first order of Huel Black Edition will come with a free t-shirt, as well as a shaker and scoop to get you started.\n\n## When will I receive my order?\n\nOrders are generally delivered within 3 to 6 business days. However, some deliveries may take longer due to additional safety measures at our fulfillment center and delays in carrier transportation.\n\n## Can I change or cancel my order?\n\nWe process orders quickly, but if you act fast, we can try to cancel them.

It provides you with all the carbohydrates, protein, fats, fiber, and all 27 essential micronutrients your body needs to thrive.\n\n## Is Black Edition a meal replacement?\n\nWhile meal replacements may seem similar to Huel Products, they are far from it. They are generally marketed and designed to support either weight loss or a fitness programme, and they're often low in calories. A two-scoop serving of Huel Black Edition is a nutritionally complete meal, containing 400 calories, a good amount of fibre and fats, and a low GI.\n\n## What is in the Black Edition Variety Box?\n\nThe Black Edition Variety Box contains three of our best-selling flavors, in one box! The perfect way to try multiple flavors and find your new favorite!\n\nThe only difference between these pouches and the rest of the Black Edition range is they are slightly smaller – they weight 31.75oz (900g) and contain 10 servings per bag. Standard Black Edition pouches weigh 54oz (1.53kg) and contain 17 servings per bag.\n\nEach pouch contains exactly the same ingredients and nutritional values as standard 17-serving Black Edition pouches.\n\n## How do I use Huel Black Edition?\n\nHuel Black Edition is quick and easy to prepare. Add **two level scoops (3 heaping tablespoons /90g)** to 1 **7 fl oz cold water with ice**, then **shake for 20 seconds**. For an extra smooth texture, you can also blend.\n\n## Is it a weight loss product?\n\nSimply, no. It’s a common misconception that carbohydrates make you gain weight. Huel Black Edition is food and weight loss is mainly about eating fewer calories than your body needs. Much like our Huel Powder and Ready-to-drink, it can help with making you feel full as it’s high in protein and fiber.\n\n## Is it suitable for a keto diet?\n\nIt could form part of a keto diet. However, a typical keto diet is typically higher in fat and lower in protein than Huel Black Edition.\n\n## Do I get free Huel stuff with my order?\n\nLike all first purchases at Huel, your first order of Huel Black Edition will come with a free t-shirt, as well as a shaker and scoop to get you started.\n\n## When will I receive my order?\n\nOrders are generally delivered within 3 to 6 business days. However, some deliveries may take longer due to additional safety measures at our fulfillment center and delays in carrier transportation.\n\n## Can I change or cancel my order?\n\nWe process orders quickly, but if you act fast, we can try to cancel them. To request a change, contact us via [email](https://huel.com/pages/contact-us) or [WhatsApp](https://huel.com/pages/contact-us) (9 am-5 pm).\n\n![](https://images.ctfassets.net/z5siblnwi90s/5IdwjdIpvMKwxXGDl5n1sl/8ab33e5865617685fdad10c80759478a/footerDesktopLarge__1_.png?fm=png&w=3500&q=35)\n\n![BCorp logo](https://images.ctfassets.net/z5siblnwi90s/7myuuA1ndVXlz9h4mnUguF/0712b4eb1bb2e9f9e0358f8ff5c9a46f/b-corp.png?fm=png&w=3500&q=35)\n\n![Transparent Image](https://images.ctfassets.net/z5siblnwi90s/5pDNXOmmVysMvggrgFisVs/a21e07f70042e14cecb6941a9583988d/Transparent_Image.png?fm=png&w=3500&q=35)\n\nPlant-based nutrition to help the planet thrive\n\nAll Huel products are 100% vegan, designed for low-carbon eating.\n\n[See our commitments](https://huel.com/pages/sustainability-page)\n\nFood\n\n- [Powdered meals](https://huel.com/collections/huel-powder)\n- [Hot meals](https://huel.com/collections/huel-instant-meals)\n- [On-the-go](https://huel.com/collections/huel-rtd)\n- [Huel Daily Greens](https://huel.com/collections/greens-superfoods)\n- [Snacks](https://huel.com/collections/drinks-snacks)\n- [Nutrition](https://huel.com/pages/beginners-guide-to-nutrition)\n- [Accessories](https://huel.com/collections/merch/accessories)\n\nCompany\n\n- [FAQs and help center](https://huel.com/pages/faq)\n- [Contact us](https://huel.com/pages/contact-us)\n- [Delivery & returns](https://huel.com/pages/delivery-questions)\n- [Terms](https://huel.com/pages/terms-and-conditions)\n- [Privacy](https://huel.com/pages/privacy-policy)\n- [Reviews](https://huel.com/pages/customer-testimonials)\n- [Huel discount codes](https://huel.com/pages/official-huel-discount-codes)\n- [Modern slavery statement](https://huel.com/pages/huel-modern-slavery-statement-2021)\n\nSupport\n\n- [Press](https://huel.com/pages/press-coverage)\n- [Careers](https://careers.huel.com/jobs)\n- [Medical staff discount](https://huel.com/pages/medical-discount)\n- [Student discount](https://huel.com/pages/student-discount)\n- [Collab with us](https://huel.com/pages/join-our-influencer-program)\n- [Store locator](https://huel.com/pages/huel-store-locator)\n- [Sustainability](https://huel.com/pages/sustainability-page)\n- [Forum](https://discourse.huel.com/)\n\nFood\n\n- [Powdered meals](https://huel.com/collections/huel-powder)\n- [Hot meals](https://huel.com/collections/huel-instant-meals)\n- [On-the-go](https://huel.com/collections/huel-rtd)\n- [Huel Daily Greens](https://huel.com/collections/greens-superfoods)\n- [Snacks](https://huel.com/collections/drinks-snacks)\n- [Nutrition](https://huel.com/pages/beginners-guide-to-nutrition)\n- [Accessories](https://huel.com/collections/merch/accessories)\n\nCompany\n\n- [FAQs and help center](https://huel.com/pages/faq)\n- [Contact us](https://huel.com/pages/contact-us)\n- [Delivery & returns](https://huel.com/pages/delivery-questions)\n- [Terms](https://huel.com/pages/terms-and-conditions)\n- [Privacy](https://huel.com/pages/privacy-policy)\n- [Reviews](https://huel.com/pages/customer-testimonials)\n- [Huel discount codes](https://huel.com/pages/official-huel-discount-codes)\n- [Modern slavery statement](https://huel.com/pages/huel-modern-slavery-statement-2021)\n\nSupport\n\n- [Press](https://huel.com/pages/press-coverage)\n- [Careers](https://careers.huel.com/jobs)\n- [Medical staff discount](https://huel.com/pages/medical-discount)\n- [Student discount](https://huel.com/pages/student-discount)\n- [Collab with us](https://huel.com/pages/join-our-influencer-program)\n- [Store locator](https://huel.com/pages/huel-store-locator)\n- [Sustainability](https://huel.com/pages/sustainability-page)\n- [Forum](https://discourse.huel.com/)\n\n![United States](https://huel.io/flags/us.svg?fm=png&w=3500&q=35)\n\nUnited States\n\n© 2015 - 2025 Huel Limited.

That's why we used full nose-to-tail beef protein, organs, colostrum, fruit, maple, date, and coconut water powder.\n\nEverything you need and _nothing_ you don't.\n\n![](https://lineageprovisions.com/cdn/shop/files/lineagehandinbag.jpg?v=1707512857&width=1176)\n\n## Real Food And Nothing Else\n\nReal food should be the cornerstone of any thriving human diet. If you're going to supplement, you should supplement with _**more real food**_, not ultra-processed isolated forms of things.\n\nYou're not going to find any xanthan gum, silicone dioxide, lecithins, flavorings, alternative sweeteners, or \"proprietary blends\" here.\n\nWe also tested every single ingredient to be _free of 390+ common contaminants_ like glyphosate, mycotoxins, heavy metals, pesticides, and herbicides.\n\nNote: This product is UNFLAVORED.

Always prioritize real foods in whole form. We made this _supplement_ (not meal replacement) for easy on-the-go way to get more organs and protein and to buffer any gaps you might have in your animal-based diet.\n\nWhy do you use beef protein over whey?\n\nBeef protein is fully nose-to-tail. We use the whole carcass (muscle meat, joints, and connective tissue) so it is packed with the collagen, gelatin, and micro-nutrients your body needs. Unlike other protein powders, it’s not packed with possible allergens found in soy, dairy, egg, or whey. Our careful dose of real-food ingredients gives you the nutrients you need to build muscle, and repair ligaments, tendons, joins, hair, and skin. Plus, AB Complete is non-inflammatory. Most other animal-based protein powders can cause inflammation (such as powders made from egg protein), not beef protein. It’s just 20-grams of 100% grass-fed beef in every scoop. Lastly, studies have shown that beef protein provides additional benefits to strength, hypertrophy, and fat loss over whey.\n\nWhat does AB Complete taste like?\n\nThe taste is fairly neutral so it can be easily incorporated into whatever drink you'd like without affecting the taste.\n\nWe intentionally didn't flavor this product so you could use it however you'd like.\n\nSo many people have sensitivities so we wanted to make the purest product with no flavors or sweeteners so anyone can thrive using this product.\n\nWant to see flavors? [Fill out this survey](https://r433voyc44t.typeform.com/to/Z05ttmWb \"https://r433voyc44t.typeform.com/to/Z05ttmWb\") and we will get on it!\n\nWhen should I use AB Complete?\n\nAB Complete is the perfect supplement to have whenever you want the power of animal-based nutrition, that’s because it packed full of everything you need and nothing you don't.\n\nIt’s more than a supplement. It’s a natural source of the collagen, gelatin, carbs, minerals and micro-nutrients that have fueled humans for many generations.\n\nTake ABC after a workout to build muscle and repair ligaments and take it as a meal replacement. With ABC, it’s never been easier to feed your body\n\nWhat is the amino acid of your beef protein?\n\nOur grass-fed beef protein provides **complete protein.** Typical values: Grams per 25g serving: Alanine: 2.2 Arginine: 1.89 Aspartic acid: 1.5 Cystine + cystein: 0.03 Glutamic acid: 2.75 Glycine: 5 Histidine: 0.28 Hydroxyproline: 2.55 Isoleucine: 0.43 Leucine: 0.93 Lysine: 0.95 Methionine: 0.23 Phenylalanine: 0.58 Proline: 3 Serine: 0.85 Threonine: 0.53 Tryptophane: 0.09 Tyrosine: 0.33 Valine: 0.75\n\nWhere are you sourcing your beef from?\n\nAs we’re building out our network of small farms, we are sourcing from the places with the best practices, including USA, New Zealand, and Australia. Dr. Paul Saladino, Dr. Anthony Gustin (an actual farmer) and the team are personally vetting and hand selected these farms. We take this very seriously. We hope you can taste the quality!\n\nDo you use chemicals to turn these ingredients into powders?\n\nNo! We strictly use freeze-drying, thermal, and mechanical processing to keep our ingredients clean and as natural as possible.\n\nWhat if I don't like it?\n\nIf you don’t like the product we have a 100% money back guarantee. So feel free to give it a try and let us know what you think!\n\nWhy does it clump if I mix it with a spoon?\n\nOur ABC powder can clump because we do not use any weird fillers, stabilizers, or gumming agents. This means you're getting a real food product and not a bunch of weird stuff that may disrupt your gut microbiome and hormones.\n\nIf you need a hand, check out our frother to whip up your ABC shake in under 10 seconds with no clumps!\n\n![](https://lineageprovisions.com/cdn/shop/t/32/assets/HealthSpirit.png?v=148570688161010763911742499240)\n\n## Join our newsletter\n\nFor new product announcements and exclusive free content and guides:\n\n![](https://lineageprovisions.com/cdn/shop/t/32/assets/HealthSpirit.png?v=148570688161010763911742499240)\n\nEmail\n\n\nJoin Free\n\n\n## Shop All\n\n- [Regen Roast Coffee](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/regen-roast-coffee)\n- [Grass-Fed Nose-to-Tail Collagen](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/nose-to-tail-collagen)\n- [Grass-Fed Air-Dried Steak](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/100-grass-fed-air-dried-steak)\n- [Meat & Organ Sticks](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/classic-meat-sticks)\n- [100% Organic Raw Honey](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/organic-raw-honey)\n- [100% Grass-Fed Beef Tallow](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/100-grass-fed-beef-tallow)\n- [AB Complete Beef & Organ Protein Powder](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/animal-based-complete-grass-fed-beef-protein-organ-fruit-powder)\n- [Creatine Monohydrate](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/creatine-monohydrate)\n- [The Frother](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/the-frother)\n\n## More\n\n- [Our Story](https://lineageprovisions.com/pages/our-story)\n- [Track My Order](https://lineage-provisions.gorgias.help/en-US/ssp/login)\n- [Help & FAQs](https://lineage-provisions.gorgias.help/en-US)\n- [Contact Us](https://lineageprovisions.com/pages/contact-us)\n- [Account](https://lineageprovisions.com/a/account)\n- [Become an Affiliate](https://lineageprovisions.superfiliate.com/portal/signUp)\n- [Wholesale Inquiries](https://form.typeform.com/to/EqFt0H1U)\n- [Brand Partnership Inquiry](https://form.typeform.com/to/fDyobS6O)\n\n## Follow Us\n\n[#lineageprovisions](https://www.instagram.com/lineageprovisions/)\n\n- [Terms](https://lineageprovisions.com/policies/terms-of-service)\n- [Privacy Policy](https://lineageprovisions.com/policies/privacy-policy)\n- [Return and Refund Policy](https://lineageprovisions.com/policies/refund-policy)\n- [Medical Disclaimer](https://lineageprovisions.com/pages/medical-disclaimer)\n\nStatements made on this website have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Made with grass-fed beef and organs with nothing I don't want. _Finally a protein I can recommend and take myself._\n\n\n\n![<em>Paul</em> Saladino MD](https://lineageprovisions.com/cdn/shop/files/Paul_nature_2_3.png?v=1707247625&width=200)\n\n_Paul_ Saladino MD\n\n- Liver and heart are such nutrient-rich foods, and they’re so valuable for me in my diet. _I love the convenience of Lineage meat sticks_ to get these organs in my diet.\n\n\n\n![<em>Georges</em> St-Pierre, UFC Hall of Fame Fighter](https://lineageprovisions.com/cdn/shop/files/lineage-georges-st-pierre-min.jpg?v=1709745097&width=200)\n\n_Georges_ St-Pierre, UFC Hall of Fame Fighter\n\n- This is a protein powder _that I can trust_.

I’d been looking for an easy and actually enjoyable way to add organ meats and quality protein to my day, and this is it. AB Complete has become a game-changer for me.\n\n\n\nThe Chocolate/Maple flavor is absolutely delicious—it shines through and makes it something I actually look forward to.\n\n\n\nAs someone who’s struggled with gut issues for years, I’ve never been able to tolerate protein powders. They always gave me gas, bloating, even breakouts. But not this one. No reactions, just clean energy and satisfaction.\n\n\n\nThis is hands-down the only protein I trust right now. Real food, real results.\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Customer-uploaded image, show more details](https://d3g5hqndtiniji.cloudfront.net/images/91e27c48-e31b-4dfc-a4f4-a2a3c792d1ee/6c844ec9-5a72-4235-93c6-982ce70a786b.jpg?d=300x400&crop=center)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- ![Customer-uploaded image, show more details](https://d3g5hqndtiniji.cloudfront.net/images/91e27c48-e31b-4dfc-a4f4-a2a3c792d1ee/6c844ec9-5a72-4235-93c6-982ce70a786b.jpg?d=x200)\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nYes, this review was helpful 0 people voted yesNo, this review was not helpful 0 people voted no\n\n- **NG**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Narek G.**\n\n\n\nVerified Reviewer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0752/7078/3286/files/ABC_Choc_render_x280.png?v=1731332420)](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/animal-based-complete-chocolate)\n\n\n\nReviewing\n\n[Animal-Based Complete – Chocolate](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/animal-based-complete-chocolate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI recommend this product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRated 4 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved it just a little confused\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I got the protein, honestly one of the best I've ever had I'm just a little confused since I thought the level of contaminants was virtually nothing.

Always prioritize real foods in whole form. We made this _supplement_ (not meal replacement) for easy on-the-go way to get more organs and protein and to buffer any gaps you might have in your animal-based diet.\n\nWhy do you use beef protein over whey?\n\nBeef protein is fully nose-to-tail. We use the whole carcass (muscle meat, joints, and connective tissue) so it is packed with the collagen, gelatin, and micro-nutrients your body needs. Unlike other protein powders, it’s not packed with possible allergens found in soy, dairy, egg, or whey. Our careful dose of real-food ingredients gives you the nutrients you need to build muscle, and repair ligaments, tendons, joins, hair, and skin. Plus, AB Complete is non-inflammatory. Most other animal-based protein powders can cause inflammation (such as powders made from egg protein), not beef protein. It’s just 20-grams of 100% grass-fed beef in every scoop. Lastly, studies have shown that beef protein provides additional benefits to strength, hypertrophy, and fat loss over whey.\n\nWhat does AB Complete taste like?\n\nThe taste is fairly neutral so it can be easily incorporated into whatever drink you'd like without affecting the taste.\n\nWe intentionally didn't flavor this product so you could use it however you'd like.\n\nSo many people have sensitivities so we wanted to make the purest product with no flavors or sweeteners so anyone can thrive using this product.\n\nWant to see flavors? [Fill out this survey](https://r433voyc44t.typeform.com/to/Z05ttmWb \"https://r433voyc44t.typeform.com/to/Z05ttmWb\") and we will get on it!\n\nWhen should I use AB Complete?\n\nAB Complete is the perfect supplement to have whenever you want the power of animal-based nutrition, that’s because it packed full of everything you need and nothing you don't.\n\nIt’s more than a supplement. It’s a natural source of the collagen, gelatin, carbs, minerals and micro-nutrients that have fueled humans for many generations.\n\nTake ABC after a workout to build muscle and repair ligaments and take it as a meal replacement. With ABC, it’s never been easier to feed your body\n\nWhat is the amino acid of your beef protein?\n\nOur grass-fed beef protein provides **complete protein.** Typical values: Grams per 25g serving: Alanine: 2.2 Arginine: 1.89 Aspartic acid: 1.5 Cystine + cystein: 0.03 Glutamic acid: 2.75 Glycine: 5 Histidine: 0.28 Hydroxyproline: 2.55 Isoleucine: 0.43 Leucine: 0.93 Lysine: 0.95 Methionine: 0.23 Phenylalanine: 0.58 Proline: 3 Serine: 0.85 Threonine: 0.53 Tryptophane: 0.09 Tyrosine: 0.33 Valine: 0.75\n\nWhere are you sourcing your beef from?\n\nAs we’re building out our network of small farms, we are sourcing from the places with the best practices, including USA, New Zealand, and Australia. Dr. Paul Saladino, Dr. Anthony Gustin (an actual farmer) and the team are personally vetting and hand selected these farms. We take this very seriously. We hope you can taste the quality!\n\nDo you use chemicals to turn these ingredients into powders?\n\nNo! We strictly use freeze-drying, thermal, and mechanical processing to keep our ingredients clean and as natural as possible.\n\nWhat if I don't like it?\n\nIf you don’t like the product we have a 100% money back guarantee. So feel free to give it a try and let us know what you think!\n\nWhy does it clump if I mix it with a spoon?\n\nOur ABC powder can clump because we do not use any weird fillers, stabilizers, or gumming agents. This means you're getting a real food product and not a bunch of weird stuff that may disrupt your gut microbiome and hormones.\n\nIf you need a hand, check out our frother to whip up your ABC shake in under 10 seconds with no clumps!\n\n![](https://lineageprovisions.com/cdn/shop/t/32/assets/HealthSpirit.png?v=148570688161010763911742499240)\n\n## Join our newsletter\n\nFor new product announcements and exclusive free content and guides:\n\n![](https://lineageprovisions.com/cdn/shop/t/32/assets/HealthSpirit.png?v=148570688161010763911742499240)\n\nEmail\n\n\nJoin Free\n\n\n## Shop All\n\n- [Regen Roast Coffee](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/regen-roast-coffee)\n- [Grass-Fed Nose-to-Tail Collagen](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/nose-to-tail-collagen)\n- [Grass-Fed Air-Dried Steak](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/100-grass-fed-air-dried-steak)\n- [Meat & Organ Sticks](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/classic-meat-sticks)\n- [100% Organic Raw Honey](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/organic-raw-honey)\n- [100% Grass-Fed Beef Tallow](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/100-grass-fed-beef-tallow)\n- [AB Complete Beef & Organ Protein Powder](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/animal-based-complete-grass-fed-beef-protein-organ-fruit-powder)\n- [Creatine Monohydrate](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/creatine-monohydrate)\n- [The Frother](https://lineageprovisions.com/products/the-frother)\n\n## More\n\n- [Our Story](https://lineageprovisions.com/pages/our-story)\n- [Track My Order](https://lineage-provisions.gorgias.help/en-US/ssp/login)\n- [Help & FAQs](https://lineage-provisions.gorgias.help/en-US)\n- [Contact Us](https://lineageprovisions.com/pages/contact-us)\n- [Account](https://lineageprovisions.com/a/account)\n- [Become an Affiliate](https://lineageprovisions.superfiliate.com/portal/signUp)\n- [Wholesale Inquiries](https://form.typeform.com/to/EqFt0H1U)\n- [Brand Partnership Inquiry](https://form.typeform.com/to/fDyobS6O)\n\n## Follow Us\n\n[#lineageprovisions](https://www.instagram.com/lineageprovisions/)\n\n- [Terms](https://lineageprovisions.com/policies/terms-of-service)\n- [Privacy Policy](https://lineageprovisions.com/policies/privacy-policy)\n- [Return and Refund Policy](https://lineageprovisions.com/policies/refund-policy)\n- [Medical Disclaimer](https://lineageprovisions.com/pages/medical-disclaimer)\n\nStatements made on this website have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

This means it often includes hormones, antibiotics, and inflammatory proteins unless highly purified — and even then, it can cause digestive discomfort for many. Beef protein is naturally dairy-free and better aligned with how humans historically consumed protein: from animals, not milk byproducts.\n\n### Collagen\n\n**Per Scoop: 5g**\n\n**What it is:** Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body — it's the structural foundation for your skin, joints, bones, and connective tissues.\n\n**Why it's included:** As we age, collagen production naturally declines, leading to joint discomfort, slower recovery, and visible signs of aging like wrinkles and sagging skin. By including collagen-rich ingredients like beef protein, bone, and marrow, we help replenish what the body is losing.\n\n**Why it’s better:**\n\n- **Not just skin deep:** Collagen supports the integrity of your gut lining, improves joint health, and enhances recovery — making it a foundational nutrient for whole-body wellness.\n- **Whole-food sourced:** Unlike many collagen supplements that isolate one or two types, we deliver naturally occurring, full-spectrum collagen from real bone and connective tissue — the way nature intended.\n- **Visible & tangible benefits:** Users often report stronger hair and nails, improved mobility, and smoother skin within weeks.\n\n_Collagen isn’t just a cosmetic boost — it’s a structural necessity that keeps your body resilient, strong, and youthful._\n\n### Nose-to-Tail Organ Blend\n\n**Per Scoop: 175mg**\n\n#### A potent blend of nutrient-dense organs and tissues — restoring what the modern diet has lost.\n\n**Why it matters:** For thousands of years, people ate the whole animal — not just the muscle meat. Organs were prized for their ability to nourish the body in ways that ordinary cuts can't. They’re packed with rare nutrients that support everything from energy and immunity to digestion and recovery. By including a wide range of organs, we help restore a fuller, more complete nutrition profile — one your body instinctively understands and craves. Even if you’ve never eaten organ meats, your body knows what to do with them.\n\n### **Bovine Liver**\n\nNature’s multivitamin: rich in retinol (vitamin A), heme iron, B12, copper, and choline. Supports energy, detox, brain health, and red blood cell formation.\n\n### **Bovine Heart**\n\nRich in CoQ10, selenium, and B vitamins. Supports mitochondrial energy and cardiovascular health.\n\n### **Bovine Kidney**\n\nSource of DAO enzyme and selenium. Aids in detox and may help regulate histamine levels.\n\n### **Bovine Spleen**\n\nHigh in heme iron and immune-regulating peptides. Traditionally used to support immune function and blood health.\n\n### **Bovine Pancreas**\n\nProvides natural digestive enzymes (protease, lipase, amylase). Supports digestive health and nutrient absorption.\n\n### **Blood**\n\nDelivers bioavailable heme iron and essential peptides. Enhances oxygen transport, energy levels, and vitality.\n\n### **Bone & Marrow**\n\nRich in collagen, calcium, phosphorus, and marrow-specific lipids. Supports joints, connective tissue, gut lining, and immunity.\n\n### Colostrum\n\n**Per Scoop: 25mg**\n\n**What it is:** Colostrum is the first milk produced after birth — nature’s original superfood. It's rich in growth factors, immune proteins, and regenerative compounds designed to kickstart life.\n\n**Why it's included:** Colostrum supports gut health, enhances immunity, aids in recovery, and promotes total-body resilience. It works synergistically with protein and collagen to help your body heal and perform at its best.\n\n**Why it’s better:**\n\n- **Immune support:** Packed with immunoglobulins (IgG), lactoferrin, and antimicrobial peptides that help strengthen your body's natural defenses.\n- **Gut healing:** Colostrum helps seal and restore the gut lining, making it powerful for digestion, nutrient absorption, and reducing inflammation.\n- **Performance & recovery:** Growth factors in colostrum promote muscle repair, cellular regeneration, and faster recovery from physical stress.\n\n_Colostrum is one of the most effective natural compounds for restoring health at the cellular level. While most protein powders focus only on muscles, we go deeper — nourishing the systems that support longevity and vitality._\n\n### L-Leucine\n\n**Per Scoop: 25mg**\n\n**What it is:** A branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and one of the nine essential amino acids your body can't produce on its own. It plays a key role in muscle repair, recovery, and metabolism.\n\n**Why it's included:** L-Leucine directly activates mTOR, the primary muscle-building pathway in the body. It kickstarts muscle protein synthesis and helps reduce muscle breakdown—especially critical during training, fasting, or aging.\n\n**Why it’s better:**\n\n- **Muscle-first fuel:** It’s the most anabolic of all the amino acids, meaning it’s the main driver of muscle growth and repair.\n- **Backed by research:** Clinical studies support L-Leucine’s role in improving recovery, preserving lean mass, and preventing muscle wasting.\n- **Age-defying:** As we get older, we become less sensitive to protein. L-Leucine helps overcome that resistance, making it vital for long-term strength and mobility.\n- **Real results, not fluff:** Unlike generic BCAA blends with filler ratios, Noble uses leucine in a meaningful, research-backed dose to support real performance and recovery.\n\n![](https://nobleorigins.com/cdn/shop/files/15.png?v=1743712188&width=1284)\n\n## Our Mission\n\nAt Noble Origins, we believe health is more than just the absence of illness—it is the foundation for a life of strength, service, and purpose.\n\nThrough God-given nourishment, traditional wisdom, and whole-body healing, we help people restore their vitality in alignment with divine design.

Through an advanced process, we isolate the protein, removing excess fat, cholesterol, and non-protein components—leaving you with clean, muscle-building fuel that’s:\n\n- Rich in Essential Amino Acids – Supports strength, recovery, and peak performance\n- Highly Bioavailable & Gut-Friendly – Easy to digest, no bloating, and naturally lactose-free\n- Pure & Efficient – Each serving packs 21g of protein with just 85 calories\n\nNo fillers. No junk. Just fuel.\n\n### Does Noble contain whey, casein, or lactose?\n\nAt Noble, we use 100% Beef Protein Isolate as our primary protein source—meaning our formula is completely whey-free and free from traditional dairy-based proteins like whey and casein.\n\nHowever, we also include grass-fed bovine colostrum—a powerful superfood known for its immune-boosting and recovery benefits.\n\nWhile colostrum does naturally contain trace amounts of whey, casein, and lactose, here’s what you should know:\n\n- Pure Beef Protein Isolate – The primary protein source, completely whey-free\n- Minimal Colostrum Content – Only 25mg per serving (compared to a full 1g serving size)\n- Still Gut-Friendly – Most customers with dairy sensitivities tolerate it well\n\nIf you’re severely allergic to dairy, you’ll want to consider these trace amounts. But if you’re simply avoiding whey or lactose, Noble is one of the cleanest, most digestible protein options available.\n\n### What are the benefits of beef protein isolate over whey or plant-based proteins?\n\nAt Noble Origins, we believe in fueling modern performance with the power of real nutrition—and that starts with choosing the right protein. While whey has long been a go-to, beef protein isolate delivers next-level benefits that align with your lifestyle. Here’s why:\n\nLactose-Free & Gut-Friendly – No dairy? No problem. Unlike whey, beef protein is naturally lactose-free, making it easier on digestion and a perfect fit for those with sensitivities or anyone ditching dairy for good.\n\nMore Than Just Protein – Our grass-fed beef protein isolate isn’t just about hitting macros—it’s packed with iron, B vitamins, and essential nutrients that support energy, endurance, and overall health.\n\nBuilt for Carnivore, Paleo & Keto Lifestyles – No soy, no fillers, no compromises. Whether you're Carnivore, Paleo, or Keto, Noble’s beef protein is designed to keep you strong, nourished, and thriving—just like your ancestors intended.\n\nDitch the dairy, embrace the power of beef, and fuel up!\n\n### How do I become an Affiliate?\n\nAt Noble Origins, we love partnering with like-minded individuals who believe in real nutrition, clean fuel, and a back-to-basics approach to health.\n\nIf you’re passionate about real food, peak performance, and helping others discover the power of grass-fed beef protein, our affiliate program might be a perfect fit.\n\nWhy Join the Noble Origins Affiliate Program?\n\n- Earn up to 20% commissions for sharing Noble with your community\n- Get exclusive access to discounts, promos, free product and insider perks\n- Be part of a movement bringing real nutrition to the modern world\n\nReady to team up?

Here’s what sets us apart:\n\nNose-to-Tail Nutrition – We go beyond just beef protein isolate. Our formula includes grass-fed bovine colostrum, delivering vital growth factors, immune-boosting nutrients, and enhanced recovery benefits you won’t find in standard beef protein powders.\n\nUltra-Clean Ingredients – No artificial flavors, no sketchy fillers—just premium grass-fed beef protein, naturally flavored with Dutch cocoa or vanilla, and sweetened with stevia.\n\nSuperior Digestibility – Unlike some beef proteins that use harsh processing methods, our hydrolyzed beef protein isolate is easy on digestion, lactose-free, and designed for maximum absorption.\n\nDesigned for the Modern Athlete – Whether you’re Carnivore, Paleo, or Keto, Noble fits seamlessly into your lifestyle, helping you fuel up without compromise.\n\nBottom line?

Have already shared it with others and will definitely be a repeat customer. Great stuff.\n\n05/07/2025\n\nVigo\n\nWe have found this protein is everything stated on its site, packaging and social media. Flavor: 10, non bloating: 10, energizing: 10, easily mixes: 10\n\nA perfect compliment to a whole food diet.\n\n04/23/2025\n\nJerri\n\n**Great product**\n\nI love the ingredients, the flavor and the mix ability.\n\n04/08/2025\n\nCharles M\n\n**Best ALL AROUND!**\n\nWhere has Noble been all my life. This is the best tasting protein powder I've ever tasted. Remarkable nutrient profile and sourcing! I'll never need to search for a convenient source of protein again.\n\n04/08/2025\n\nTalia W.\n\n**Active 58 yr old ....Tastes Great, Clean Ingredients, and High Protein – I'm Sold**\n\nI’ve tried a lot of protein shakes, and Noble’s chocolate flavor is easily one of the best. It’s smooth, mixes well (especially in a shaker bottle for a quick grab), and doesn’t have that chalky or artificial aftertaste some shakes do. I actually prefer it without the blender unless I’m adding extras like fruit or nut butter.\n\nWhat really impressed me was the ingredient label. I’ve been a regular \"other\" protein drink drinker for years, but when I compared the two, Noble stood out — it’s high in protein, has great nutritional value, and skips the long list of hard-to-pronounce additives. It feels like a cleaner, more natural option, which I really appreciate.\n\nIf you’re looking for a high-protein shake that tastes great and keeps it simple, Noble is 100% worth a try.\n\n123\n\n- ![Image of item](https://nobleorigins.com/cdn/shop/files/Group_603_e9ad2f34-1528-42c6-8804-8c41a5813bc3.svg?v=1711610397)\n\n##### Optimal Health\n\n\nThe All-in-One Protein Shake offers unmatched nutrient density.

This means it often includes hormones, antibiotics, and inflammatory proteins unless highly purified — and even then, it can cause digestive discomfort for many. Beef protein is naturally dairy-free and better aligned with how humans historically consumed protein: from animals, not milk byproducts.\n\n### Collagen\n\n**Per Scoop: 5g**\n\n**What it is:** Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body — it's the structural foundation for your skin, joints, bones, and connective tissues.\n\n**Why it's included:** As we age, collagen production naturally declines, leading to joint discomfort, slower recovery, and visible signs of aging like wrinkles and sagging skin. By including collagen-rich ingredients like beef protein, bone, and marrow, we help replenish what the body is losing.\n\n**Why it’s better:**\n\n- **Not just skin deep:** Collagen supports the integrity of your gut lining, improves joint health, and enhances recovery — making it a foundational nutrient for whole-body wellness.\n- **Whole-food sourced:** Unlike many collagen supplements that isolate one or two types, we deliver naturally occurring, full-spectrum collagen from real bone and connective tissue — the way nature intended.\n- **Visible & tangible benefits:** Users often report stronger hair and nails, improved mobility, and smoother skin within weeks.\n\n_Collagen isn’t just a cosmetic boost — it’s a structural necessity that keeps your body resilient, strong, and youthful._\n\n### Nose-to-Tail Organ Blend\n\n**Per Scoop: 175mg**\n\n#### A potent blend of nutrient-dense organs and tissues — restoring what the modern diet has lost.\n\n**Why it matters:** For thousands of years, people ate the whole animal — not just the muscle meat. Organs were prized for their ability to nourish the body in ways that ordinary cuts can't. They’re packed with rare nutrients that support everything from energy and immunity to digestion and recovery. By including a wide range of organs, we help restore a fuller, more complete nutrition profile — one your body instinctively understands and craves. Even if you’ve never eaten organ meats, your body knows what to do with them.\n\n### **Bovine Liver**\n\nNature’s multivitamin: rich in retinol (vitamin A), heme iron, B12, copper, and choline. Supports energy, detox, brain health, and red blood cell formation.\n\n### **Bovine Heart**\n\nRich in CoQ10, selenium, and B vitamins. Supports mitochondrial energy and cardiovascular health.\n\n### **Bovine Kidney**\n\nSource of DAO enzyme and selenium. Aids in detox and may help regulate histamine levels.\n\n### **Bovine Spleen**\n\nHigh in heme iron and immune-regulating peptides. Traditionally used to support immune function and blood health.\n\n### **Bovine Pancreas**\n\nProvides natural digestive enzymes (protease, lipase, amylase). Supports digestive health and nutrient absorption.\n\n### **Blood**\n\nDelivers bioavailable heme iron and essential peptides. Enhances oxygen transport, energy levels, and vitality.\n\n### **Bone & Marrow**\n\nRich in collagen, calcium, phosphorus, and marrow-specific lipids. Supports joints, connective tissue, gut lining, and immunity.\n\n### Colostrum\n\n**Per Scoop: 25mg**\n\n**What it is:** Colostrum is the first milk produced after birth — nature’s original superfood. It's rich in growth factors, immune proteins, and regenerative compounds designed to kickstart life.\n\n**Why it's included:** Colostrum supports gut health, enhances immunity, aids in recovery, and promotes total-body resilience. It works synergistically with protein and collagen to help your body heal and perform at its best.\n\n**Why it’s better:**\n\n- **Immune support:** Packed with immunoglobulins (IgG), lactoferrin, and antimicrobial peptides that help strengthen your body's natural defenses.\n- **Gut healing:** Colostrum helps seal and restore the gut lining, making it powerful for digestion, nutrient absorption, and reducing inflammation.\n- **Performance & recovery:** Growth factors in colostrum promote muscle repair, cellular regeneration, and faster recovery from physical stress.\n\n_Colostrum is one of the most effective natural compounds for restoring health at the cellular level. While most protein powders focus only on muscles, we go deeper — nourishing the systems that support longevity and vitality._\n\n### L-Leucine\n\n**Per Scoop: 25mg**\n\n**What it is:** A branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and one of the nine essential amino acids your body can't produce on its own. It plays a key role in muscle repair, recovery, and metabolism.\n\n**Why it's included:** L-Leucine directly activates mTOR, the primary muscle-building pathway in the body. It kickstarts muscle protein synthesis and helps reduce muscle breakdown—especially critical during training, fasting, or aging.\n\n**Why it’s better:**\n\n- **Muscle-first fuel:** It’s the most anabolic of all the amino acids, meaning it’s the main driver of muscle growth and repair.\n- **Backed by research:** Clinical studies support L-Leucine’s role in improving recovery, preserving lean mass, and preventing muscle wasting.\n- **Age-defying:** As we get older, we become less sensitive to protein. L-Leucine helps overcome that resistance, making it vital for long-term strength and mobility.\n- **Real results, not fluff:** Unlike generic BCAA blends with filler ratios, Noble uses leucine in a meaningful, research-backed dose to support real performance and recovery.\n\n![](https://nobleorigins.com/cdn/shop/files/15.png?v=1743712188&width=1284)\n\n## Our Mission\n\nAt Noble Origins, we believe health is more than just the absence of illness—it is the foundation for a life of strength, service, and purpose.\n\nThrough God-given nourishment, traditional wisdom, and whole-body healing, we help people restore their vitality in alignment with divine design.

This is the best tasting protein powder I've ever tasted. Remarkable nutrient profile and sourcing!

It’s smooth, mixes well (especially in a shaker bottle for a quick grab), and doesn’t have that chalky or artificial aftertaste some shakes do. I actually prefer it without the blender unless I’m adding extras like fruit or nut butter.\n\nWhat really impressed me was the ingredient label. I’ve been a regular \"other\" protein drink drinker for years, but when I compared the two, Noble stood out — it’s high in protein, has great nutritional value, and skips the long list of hard-to-pronounce additives. It feels like a cleaner, more natural option, which I really appreciate.\n\nIf you’re looking for a high-protein shake that tastes great and keeps it simple, Noble is 100% worth a try.\n\n123\n\n- ![Image of item](https://nobleorigins.com/cdn/shop/files/Group_603_e9ad2f34-1528-42c6-8804-8c41a5813bc3.svg?v=1711610397)\n\n##### Optimal Health\n\n\nThe All-in-One Protein Shake offers unmatched nutrient density.
