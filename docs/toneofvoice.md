# Brand Tone of Voice: Nimble Nutrition

## Core Attributes

3.  **Scientific & Authoritative**
4.  **Supportive & Encouraging**

---

### 1. Empowering & Understanding

We speak to our customer as a respected equal. We acknowledge her intelligence, her challenges, and her strength. We don't talk down to her; we reflect her reality back to her with empathy and validation.

- **DO:** Use words like "strong," "resilient," "powerful," "capable."
- **DO:** Acknowledge her busy life: "leading teams, raising kids, caring for aging parents, managing a thousand invisible demands."
- **DON'T:** Use patronizing or "girl-boss" language. Avoid clichés about "doing it all."

**Example:** "Because slowing down isn't an option."

---

### 2. Direct & Honest

We build trust through radical transparency. We speak plainly and avoid hyperbole. We are confident in our product and don't need to hide behind exaggerated claims.

- **DO:** State facts clearly. Use phrases like "We're not here to sell hype," "Literally. There's no other product on the market..."
- **DO:** Set clear expectations: "We're not promising overnight results," "We're not claiming it tastes like a milkshake."
- **DON'T:** Use marketing jargon, buzzwords, or make claims we can't substantiate. Avoid words like "miracle," "instant," "magic."

**Example:** "What we are promising is a clean, thoughtfully formulated tool to support your strength, mobility, and recovery."

---

### 3. Scientific & Authoritative

We establish credibility by speaking with quiet authority. Our confidence comes from our research and the quality of our formulation. We use precise, scientific language but explain it in a way that is accessible and meaningful.

- **DO:** Name specific ingredients ("Grass-Fed Beef Protein Isolate," "Creatine Monohydrate").
- **DO:** Reference data and backing ("Clinically studied ingredients," "National Institute of Health").
- **DON't:** Overwhelm with unexplained jargon. Always connect the scientific term to a tangible benefit for the user.

**Example:** "10-15% muscle loss per decade after age 30, unless you actively intervene."

---

### 4. Supportive & Encouraging

We are a partner in her health journey, not a drill sergeant. The tone should feel like it's coming from a knowledgeable, trusted friend or advisor.

- **DO:** Use "we" to create a sense of partnership. Use words like "support," "protect," "strengthen," "aid."
- **DO:** Frame the product as a "tool" that helps her achieve her goals.
- **DON'T:** Use language that implies she is "broken" or "needs fixing." Focus on preservation, strength, and enhancement, not deficits.

**Example:** "...designed to support lean muscle, protect joints and cartilage, and strengthen bones in one daily step, so you stay strong, resilient and nimble."

## From Generic to Nimble: Before & After

Here's how to translate typical marketing copy into the Nimble tone of voice.

### Example 1: Website Headline

*   **Before:** "The Ultimate Protein Powder for Women!"
*   **After:** "Foundational nutrition for the woman who isn't slowing down."
    *   *Why it works: It shifts from generic hype ("Ultimate") to a specific, empowering idea ("Foundational nutrition") that respects the customer's identity and drive.*

### Example 2: Product Description

*   **Before:** "Our new shake helps you lose weight and feel great! It tastes amazing and is packed with everything you need to get the body you've always wanted."
*   **After:** "A single, daily scoop designed to support the body's core systems of strength and mobility. We've combined grass-fed beef protein isolate with creatine and collagen to help preserve lean muscle and protect connective tissue. It's a direct, effective tool for maintaining your physical capabilities."
    *   *Why it works: It replaces vague promises ("feel great," "amazing taste") with direct, scientific, and benefit-oriented language ("preserve lean muscle," "protect connective tissue"). It sounds authoritative and honest, not like a sales pitch.*

### Example 3: Social Media Post

*   **Before:** "Don't let aging get you down! ✨ Our new formula is the secret to staying young and beautiful. #antiaging #foreveryoung"
*   **After:** "Muscle loss begins accelerating after 30. That's a scientific reality. It's also something you can actively address. Our 4-in-1 formula is a strategic tool to support your strength and resilience, year after year. #nimblenutrition #strengththroughscience"
    *   *Why it works: It's direct, honest, and educational. It replaces the patronizing and cliché anti-aging sentiment with a fact-based, empowering call to action. It positions the brand as a credible authority.*
